	<h1>Lovelys Specialty Milk and Cookies! </h1>
		  <p> For People who have chronic conditions or for people who want to maintain their good health.</p>
		  <p> 
We are a small, family-owned milk and cookie company with a big dream: to help cure the world of the stresses of the modern age. 

While our hunter-gatherer ancestors struggled to protect themselves from nature, their lives were simple. Now,in the modern age, we are safe from most natural threats, but our lives have become increasingly more complex. The advancement of technology and society has provided many benefits and conveniences which we all enjoy, but we have also created subtle, unperceivable threats which constantly whittle us down and drain our energy, driving us slowly towards poor health. 

To exacerbate this stress-laden life we live, the agricultural industry produces incredible amounts of nutritionally deficient food through modern farming & production practices. What results is an ever-increasing energetic treadmill: the energy demands of the day increase while we slowly lose the capacity to replenish ourselves with healthy food - our most fundamental source of vital energy. 

At Lovelys, we are addressing this problem by making non-allergic milk and delicious cookies that can pick you up on your lowest days. With the earthy power of beets and ..., our cookies help you unlock the energy hidden from you by the silent chaos that is our modern society.
